made of a property: value pair 

*(an Asterick) - This is also known as the universal selector
##
* {
    color: purple;
}

class selectors will select all elements with the given class,
which is just an attribute you place on an HTML elements

the class syntax is a period immediately followed by the
case-sensitive value of the class attribute .

####
.alert-text{
    color: red
}

-> Another thing you can do with the class attribute is 
add multiple classes to a single element as a space-
separated list... e.g
 class="alert-tet severe-alert . A white space is used to
 separate class names like this, you should never use spaces
 for multiworded names and should use a hyphen instead.

    ID selectors

ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an
element with the given ID, which is another attribute you 
place on an HTML element :
 e.g
 <div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>

 #title{
     background-color: red;
 }

## ID's are usefull when making use of specificity or to
 have links redirect to a section on the current page, you
 should use IDs sparingly

below is how to comment in css

 /*The major difference between classes and IDs is that an 
 element can only have one ID. An ID cannot be repeated on
 a single page, and the ID attribute should not contain
 any whitespaces at all. 

    ###Grouping Selector

If we share two groups of elements that share some of their 
syle declarations?

Instead of having for instance :-
     .read {
         color: white;
         background-color: black;
         /* several unique declarations */
     }

     .unread {
         color: white;
         background-color: black;
         /*several unique declarations */
     }
Both .read and .unread selectors share declarations so to
cut down on repetition we can simply do this..
    .read,
    .unread{
        color: white;
        background-color: black;
    }

    ###CHAINING selectors
Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list
without any separation. Let's say we had the following HTML:

<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>

If we want to apply a separate rule to the element that also
has header as a second class, we could chain the two class selectors together
in our CSS like so:
 
 .subsection.header {
  color: red;
}

#####Descendant Combinator

Combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently
than grouing or chaining them, as they show a relationship 
between the selector
So something like .ancestor .child would select an element
with the class child if it has an ancestor with the class
ancestor. Another way to think of it is child will only be
selected if it is nested inside of ancestor, no matter how
deeply. 

#######   CSS PROPERTIES TO GET STARTED WITH   #####

color and background-color

The color property sets an element’s text color, while 
background-color sets, well, the background color of an 
element.

p {
  /* hex example: */
  color: #1100ff;
  /* rgb example: */
  color: rgb(100, 0, 127);
  /* hsl example: */
  color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);
}

This property also takes PROPERTIES
 like red or the transparent keyword.

 Typography Basics and text-align

font-family can be a single value or a comma-separated
 list of values that determine what font an element uses.
Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a 
“font family name” like "Times New Roman" (we use quotes 
due to the whitespace between words) or “generic family 
name” like sans-serif (generic family names never use 
quotes).

font-family: "Times New Roman", sans-serif;

font-size will,
as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. 
When giving a value to this property, the value should 
not contain any whitespace, e.g. font-size: 22px has no 
space between “22” and “px”.

font-weight affects the boldness of text, 
assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a 
keyword, e.g. font-weight: bold, or a number between 1 and
, e.g. font-weight: 700 (the equivalent of bold). Usually
 the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900,
though this will depend on the font.

text-align 
will align text horizontally within an element, and you 
can use the common keywords you may have come across in 
word processors as the value for this property, e.g. 
text-align: center.
